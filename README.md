This code is titled RiverWalk-Strat and it is built on a modified form of RiverWalk, a model written by me [Harrison Martin] and Doug Edmonds as part of my PhD, which can be found at: https://github.com/harrison-martin/RiverWalk. That model was described in two publications: https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-555-2022 and 
https://doi.org/10.1130/G51138.1. 

RiverWalk-Strat is the creation of Caitlin Sifuentes, Harrison Martin, and Doug Edmonds. Built off of an earlier version of RiverWalk, it consists of two scripts that run in MATLAB. The first, RiverWalk, generates landscapes as a result of an avulsing river over stratigraphic timescales. This version has been modified to save and export those landscapes at each timestep in a format that can be read by the second script, StratCode. StratCode takes the outputs from RiverWalk and constructs synthetic stratigraphy along specified strike- or dip-oriented cross-sections. It also contains tools for statistically analysing along-strike river position and stratigraphic compensation. 

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like help understanding or using the code, or for any other questions. We are also always happy to chat if you have an interesting research problem that you think the model may be able to help solve. You're also free to modify the code as you wish, in line with the GNU GPL v3.0 license (link below).           

Thanks for reading, and we hope you enjoy the code!
